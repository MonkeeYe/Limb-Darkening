This is an limb darkening implementation based on Bertello 2010 paper https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-010-9570-z.


To compile:


python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace


Create the following directories:
1. output_images
2. gradient_images
3. profiles

Run this code on ipython3 shell:


import halpha

base_path = '/Users/harshmathur/Documents/H alpha20170803/'

dark_image = 'Dark_20170803_133401800.fits'

flat_image = 'Flat_20170803_112801100.fits'

angle = 7 # 25 for H alpha, 7 for CaK images

# angle is an instrument dependent parameter, but once it is set, you can use the same parameter for all the  images from that instrument, I have done for kodaikanal solar data.
# For H alpha images, I saw angle value as 25 and for CaK images, I saw the value as 7.
